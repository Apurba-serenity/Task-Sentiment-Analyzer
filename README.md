# Task Sentiment Analyzer

A simple and efficient **Sentiment Analysis Tool** to analyze the sentiment of tasks, comments, or user feedback. This Python-based tool uses the **TextBlob** library to evaluate the sentiment and provides a detailed report with **Polarity** and **Subjectivity** scores.

---

## Features

- **Analyze Sentiment**: Detect whether the text sentiment is **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**.
- **Detailed Scoring**:
  - **Polarity**: Indicates sentiment strength on a scale from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive).
  - **Subjectivity**: Measures how subjective (personal opinion) or objective the text is.
- **Clean and Preprocess Text**: Removes special characters and extra whitespace for accurate analysis.
- **Interactive Console**: User-friendly interface to analyze single or multiple text inputs.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Designed for easy understanding and modification.

## How It Works

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
- **Positive Sentiment**: Polarity > 0
- **Neutral Sentiment**: Polarity = 0
- **Negative Sentiment**: Polarity < 0

### 2. Preprocessing
- Removes special characters (e.g., punctuation).
- Converts text to lowercase for consistent analysis.
